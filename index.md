**primetime** is a pipeline designed for the analysis of TF prime reporter data. It processes fastq files, counts barcodes, clusters them, annotates them, and performs a differential TF activity analysis. The pipeline compares different conditions of the samples based on the 'condition' field in the configuration file.
